# Movie Ticket Booking System (C)

A simple **console-based Movie Ticket Booking System** built in C. This project simulates a cinema ticket booking scenario for a small theater with 5 movies and 10 seats per movie.

## Scenario

Imagine a small local cinema called **“CineWorld”**. They want a lightweight system to:
- Display available movies and showtimes
- Search movies by title
- Book seats for customers in real-time

This system was developed to **simulate the booking experience** in such a theater. Seats are tracked in real-time, and the program prevents double booking.

## Features
- Display all available movies
- Search movies by title
- Book seats with seat availability check
- Simple menu-driven interface
